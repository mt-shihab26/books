// Here, x must be heap-allocated because it is still reachable from the variable global after f
// has returned, despite being declared as a local variable; we say x escapes from f. Conversely,
// when g returns, the variable *y becomes unreachable and can be rec ycled. Since *y does not
// escape from g, itâ€™s safe for the compiler to allocate *y on the stack, even though it was
// allocated with new.
