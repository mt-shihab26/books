## Commands

-   `go run <file-name.go>` compile, links and run
-   `go build <file-name.go` compile, links, executable binary
-   `go doc` Seeing docs

## Go has 25 keywords

-   `break`, `case`, `chan`
-   `const`, `continue`, `default`
-   `defer`, `else`, `fallthrough`
-   `for`, `func`, `go`
-   `goto`, `if`, `import`
-   `interface`, `map`, `package`
-   `range`, `return`, `select`
-   `struct` `switch`, `type`,
-   `var`

## Built-in constants, types and functions

-   Constants:
    -   `true`, `false`, `iota`,`nil`
-   Types:
    -   Integers: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`,`uintptr`
    -   Floats: `float32`, `float64`
    -   Complexes: `complex128` `complex64`
    -   Booleans: `bool`
    -   Characters: `byte` `rune`
    -   Strings: `string`
    -   Errors: `error`
-   Functions:
    -   `make`, `len`, `cap`,
    -   `new`, `append`, `copy`
    -   `close`, `delete`, `complex`
    -   `real`, `imag`, `panic`,
    -   `recover`

## ch02 - Program Structure

-   There are four major kinds of declarations:
    -   `var`, `const`, `type`, `func`
-   Zero values of Types:
    -   numbers: `0`
    -   booleans: `false`
    -   strings: `""`
    -   interface and reference types (slice, pointer, map, channel, function): `nil`
-   Pointers
    -   `&x` : address of x
    -   `*int` : pointer to int
    -   `p *int = x`: p points to x or p contains th address of x
    -   The zero value for a pointer of any type is `nil`
-   The new Function
    -   The expression `new(T)` create an unnamed variable of type T, initializes it to the zero value of T, and returns it's address, which is a value of type `*T`
    -   two variables whose type carries no information and is therefore of size zero, such as struct{} or [0]int, may, dep ending on the implementation, have the same address
    -   The new function is relatively rarely used because the most common unnamed variables are of struct types, for which the str uct literal syntax is more flexible.
-   Lifetime of Variables
    -   A compiler may choose to allocate local variables on the heap or on the stack but, perhaps surprisingly, this choice is not determined by whether var or new was used to declare the variable.
    -   Garbage collection is a tremendous help in writing cor rect programs, but it does not relieve you of the burden of thinking about memory. You donâ€™t need to explicitly allocate and free memory, but to write efficient programs you still need to be aware of the lifetime of variables. For example, keeping unnecessary pointers to short-lived objects wit hin long-lived objects, especially global variables, will prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the short-lived objects.
