// ## The environment
// The collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time is called
// the environment. When a program starts up, this environment is not empty. It
// always contains bindings that are part of the language standard, and most of the
// time, it also has bindings that provide ways to interact with the surrounding
// system. For example, in a browser, there are functions to interact with the
// currently loaded website and to read mouse and keyboard input.
